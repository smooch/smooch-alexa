# Serverless Smooch Alexa Skill Example

This example demonstrates how to setup your own Smooch Alexa skill using AWS Lambdas. It allows Alexa users to send plain-text messages as Smooch appUser messages. It also provides subsequent appMaker messages as responses, if they are received within Alexa's response window. 

## Use-cases

- Deploying chat bots to Alexa
- Creating multi-channel chat experiences that are initiated via Alexa voice commands. Imagine: _Person: Alexa, reserve Magpie Pizzeria for 3 tonight at 7 pm. Alexa: Reserving Magpie restaurant at 7pm. I'll send you confirmation by SMS, Dave._

## How it works

In the Alexa Developer Portal you can add your own skill. To do so you need to define the available intents and then connect them to a Lambda. You can update and define the Lambda with Serverless.

## Setup

_In order to use this example you must have serverless on your machine, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) to install it. If this is your first time using serverless, you will also need to [configure credentials for AWS](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/) on your local machine._

To install this skill on your machine, run:

```bash
serverless install -u https://github.com/smooch/smooch-alexa -n smooch-alexa
cd smooch-alexa
npm install
```

In order to deploy the endpoint simply run

```bash
serverless deploy
```

The expected result should be similar to:

```bash
Serverless: Packaging service...
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3...
Serverless: Uploading service .zip file to S3 (378 B)...
Serverless: Updating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack update progress...
.........
Serverless: Stack update finished...
Serverless: Removing old service versions...

```

Next we need to setup an Alexa skill. Once you've signed up for the Amazon Developer Platform visit `https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html`. There you should see the following screen and click "Get Started" on "Alexa Skill Kit":

Next click on `Add a new Skill`:

Go through the steps and fill in all the required fields e.g. Intent Schema and Sample Utterances:

Intent Schema
```
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "RawText",
      "slots": [
        {
          "name": "text",
          "type": "AMAZON.LITERAL"
        }]
    },
    {
      "intent": "AMAZON.StopIntent"
    },
    {
      "intent": "AMAZON.CancelIntent"
    }
  ]
}
```

Sample Utterances
```
RawText {word|text}
RawText {this is a sentence|text}
```

Fill in the Lambda ARN with the ARN value displayed in the AWS lambda console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda): Login to your console and open the Lambda that was generated by serverless, the ARN will be displayed on the page.

Next up visit the test page, fill in the utterance and click on `Ask the-name-of-your-skill`.

You should have received a response containing the text of any appMaker message you've configured to respond, or `"text": "Haven't heard anything back. Try again later."` if no appMaker message was sent.

You can also test your skill using a service like [echosim.io](https://echosim.io/).
